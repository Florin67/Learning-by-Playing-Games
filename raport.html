			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				This document details the project plan for the development of 'Learning by playing games'.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is intended for developers, designers and testers working on the project.
				This plan will include a summary of:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>how the system will function</li>
				<li>the scope of the project from a development viewpoint</li>
				<li>the technology used to develop the project</li>
				<li>the metrics used to determine the project’s progress</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The industrial era has brought with it highly complex machines such as computers/phones at the disposal of every household/person. The project aims to help people get accoustomed to the hardware/components of the systems that they use. The project uses entertainment as a form of teaching.
